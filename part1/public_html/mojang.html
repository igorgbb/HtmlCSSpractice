    <p>Mojang Studios is a renowned Swedish video game development company widely recognized for its creation of the
        immensely popular sandbox game, Minecraft. Founded in 2009 by Markus Persson, Mojang's primary focus has been
        the development, maintenance, and expansion of the <a href="./index.html">Minecraft</a> franchise. The company's
        commitment to innovation
        and player engagement has led to Minecraft becoming a global cultural phenomenon, allowing players to explore
        and create within a procedurally generated 3D world. Mojang's dedication to fostering creativity and community
        interaction has resulted in continuous updates and expansions to the game, ensuring its longevity and widespread
        appeal across various platforms. In 2014, Microsoft acquired Mojang Studios, further solidifying its influence
        within the gaming industry while still maintaining the studio's autonomy in game development.
